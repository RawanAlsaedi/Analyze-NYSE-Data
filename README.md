# Analyze NYSE Data
In this project, I worked with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) dataset that contains fundamental financial data for 500 companies. This dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse). 
Since the dataset is too big, I created a smaller subset of the data.

# The main parts:
-  Complete your own data analysis and create a presentation to 
   share your findings.
-  Develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement.
-  Create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.
