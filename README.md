### Introduction

In this project, I worked with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) dataset that contains fundamental financial data for 500 companies. This dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse). 
Since the dataset is too big, I created a smaller subset of the data.

### Project Description

I used Excel spreadsheet to analyze and summarize the data using statistics and data visualizations. I also designed a dashboard that calculates the financial metrics and auto populates the income statement for each company using data validation and advanced lookup tools within Excel. 
A forecast financial metrics dashboard has been made within the Income Statement, based on three scenarios with distinct assumptions for a company of my choice from the NYSE dataset.
